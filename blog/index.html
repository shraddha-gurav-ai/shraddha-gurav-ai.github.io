  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome! I‚Äôm <strong>Shraddha Gurav</strong>, an aspiring AI/ML engineer and software developer based in Mumbai, India. I created this blog to share my journey, knowledge, and experiences as a fresher entering the tech world.</p>

  <h2>üöÄ My Academic Journey</h2>
  <p>I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Theem College of Engineering. Prior to this, I earned my diploma in Information Technology and built a solid foundation in programming and system design.</p>

  <h2>üß† Key Projects</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>üîç Fraud Payment Detection Search Engine</h3>
    <p>Developed using Python and Machine Learning libraries like Pandas, this tool identifies suspicious financial transactions. It was presented at an international engineering conference.</p>

    <p>
During my engineering journey, I independently worked on a project titled <strong>"Fake Payment Detection in Transaction Using Machine Learning"</strong>, which tackled the growing issue of online payment fraud. I began by gathering and preprocessing a large dataset of transactions, handling missing values and balancing the data for accuracy. Using Python, I applied multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to analyze transaction behavior. I evaluated their performance and fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy. Feature selection played a key role, and I ensured only the most relevant variables were used for prediction. Once the model reached over 96% accuracy, I built a web-based application using Flask to make it user-friendly. Users could upload transaction files and instantly get fraud analysis results. I also designed the interface and implemented real-time detection logic. This project not only deepened my technical knowledge, but also taught me how to convert research into a working AI product with real-world impact.

<div class="project">
    <h3>üì± Aahar Donation Android App</h3>
    <p>An Android application using Firebase and Google Maps to connect food donors with NGOs. Recognized for innovation and practicality.</p>
 
<p>
Another meaningful project I worked on is the <strong>Aahar Donation App</strong> ‚Äî a real-time Android application aimed at reducing food waste by connecting donors with NGOs. I built this app using Android Studio and integrated Firebase for backend data storage and real-time updates. The app allows food donors to register and upload donation details, while NGOs can view and accept those donations nearby. I implemented Google Maps API to enable live location tracking, so users can find donations or NGOs in their vicinity. I also added features like status updates, donation history, and real-time notifications to improve the user experience. The app's interface was designed to be simple and accessible, even for users not familiar with technology. I wrote all the Java code, configured the Firebase database, and handled all user authentication and data syncs myself. Through this project, I learned how to develop scalable Android applications, manage cloud-based data, and design user-centric features that can bring social impact. Building Aahar wasn't just a technical experience ‚Äî it was a chance to create a platform with real-world purpose.

    <h3>üó≥Ô∏è Online Voting System</h3>
    <p>A secure, web-based voting portal using PHP and MySQL. Built with encryption and real-time result tracking to ensure data integrity.</p>

  <p>
One of the more technically challenging projects I developed was an <strong>Online Voting System</strong> designed to conduct secure and transparent elections over the web. I created the entire system using PHP for backend logic and MySQL for database management, ensuring that each user could vote only once through secure login validation. The application included candidate registration, voter authentication, encrypted voting sessions, and real-time result display. I paid close attention to session management and data integrity to prevent tampering or duplicate votes. The interface was designed to be intuitive so that both voters and administrators could navigate it easily. I wrote all the backend code, handled form validations, and configured the SQL database to manage roles, vote counts, and access levels. This project helped me understand real-world authentication workflows and sharpened my skills in server-side scripting and relational database design. Building this system from scratch gave me hands-on experience with web security and made
